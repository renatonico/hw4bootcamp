    "* Within each school, both reading and math scores do not vary significantly from 9th to 12th grade, although there are significant differences between schools\n",
    "* There seems to be a great divide within the larger schools. Analysing the results per student spend in math, average scores for the bottom performers are only about 7 points below the top performing schools. However, the percentage of students passing is about 28% lower, and the overall passing rate is 36% lower. This indicates there is a pool of very high scorers in schools with close to 55% overall passing rates. \n",
